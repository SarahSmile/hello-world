Hi internet world!

Have you ever heard the song, Sara Smile (by Hall and Oats)? It's pretty sweet. 
There's so many Sarahs in the world, me just being one of them...but this song makes me feel special.

"Baby hair with a woman's eyes/I can feel you watchin in the night/All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight/...Sara, smile"

Take a listen.
Do you like 80s music?
hahahahahaha XD
